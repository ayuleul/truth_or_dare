# truth_or_dare
This application is developed for two friends to play a game of truth or dare. The laws are straightforward! “Truth or dare?” picks one player whose name appears on the board. If the player selects "truth," they will be asked a question to which they must honestly respond. If they choose "dare," they will be given an order or other kind of action to complete.
the following page is the overview of the app.
